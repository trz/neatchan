neatchan
========

**An alternate stylesheet for 4chan** (still in very early stage)

Neatchan was originally meant as an alternate stylesheet to be used as a Safari extension, but its development has been made publicly available and usable for all platforms. Neatchan will be available as a Safari extension based on the stylesheet developed here.

*The purpose and utmost priority of this stylesheet is therefore to excel under Safari.*
